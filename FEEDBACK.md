User feedback and advice:

This is a fully-autonomous agent session, so please proceed with your own best pragmatic judgement and reasonable steps forward.

See supporting documentation for overall goals.  Recent events guiding this run have been focused on getting a viable Path B analog loop going with low BER, on 1 to 8 channels.  We are happy to make hardware concessions to achieve this (especially if cheap), and modify the test code to apply additional steps/methods.  Try to focus on just getting viable low-error runs even with a single channel on expensive hardware, and then gradually dialing things back up to 8-16 channels and swapping out hardware components to target a cheaper solution.

We want to get a viable MVP with 1 channel that can be easily scaled to 8-16 channels, reusing most of the hardware.  If that can be done reliably in sim, we're good to go for hardware purchases.  Achieving that then characterizing the various controls/options/hardware choices to figure out what actually matters and how low we can drive costs would be a great strategy.  We also care about speed/throughput/accuracy/etc obviously too though, so there are many things to balance.

Overall, use your own best judgement and carve out a pragmatic path forward, making any changes to the system necessary to realistically simulate the desired behavior and find viable builds.  Good luck!
