Could you recap the scalability of our fiberoptic build in terms of CAPEX, OPEX, speed, throughput, and energy cost estimates at various scales and compare them to equivalents in gpu / datacenter costs/sizes?  Go up to Trillion-param model scales, with cost estimates for fiber and gpu datacenters.  (pragmatic version for fiberoptics - it can be a co-processor with gpu assistance)


Got it—here’s a pragmatic, numbers-driven recap that treats your 1550 nm fiber build as a matvec/feature-extraction co-processor (ternary, reservoir-style) and sizes it from a 1-λ MVP up to “room-scale” tiles you could point at trillion-param workloads. I’m explicit about assumptions and I cite public anchors for GPU power/cost and recent optical baselines.

Executive take

Where optics helps most: moving a huge chunk of inner-layer multiply/accumulate into light. Microsoft’s AOC programme reports ~100× energy potential on relevant fixed-point/iterative workloads when you co-design algorithm+optics; they’ve shown real apps (finance, MRI) on hardware + a digital twin, and say the same platform can serve AI models.

Your approach (1550 nm, SOA/EDFA, WDM, ternary): cheaper parts than free-space benches; easy tiling via DWDM; acceptable per-channel watts (SOA-only few W, with EDFA tens of W); and you can scale channels linearly. Typical SOA butterfly draws a couple watts plus TEC headroom; compact EDFAs are ~10–20 W each for +20–23 dBm output; passive mux/demux are loss-only. 
AusOptic

Datacenter comparators: modern GPUs sit at ~400–700 W/GPU (A100/H100), with typical PUE 1.2–1.5 in the wild; H100 street prices have ranged $25k–$40k. Blackwell B200 MLPerf inference results show ~1,038 tok/s on an LLM benchmark for a single user (context-dependent), setting a realistic “top-end digital” reference.

Assumptions (so the estimates make sense)

Per-channel electronics & optics:
– Modulator+driver ~10 GHz class; PD+TIA ~10 GHz class.
– SOA path (“low-power”): drive ~1–2 W + TEC overhead (2–5 W worst-case).
– EDFA path (“high-gain”): 10–20 W per stage (small 1U/bench Edfas). 
AusOptic

Encoding: 3-level (ternary) symbols; effective payload ≈ log2(3)=1.585 bits/symbol per channel.

Symbol rate: use 10 Gbaud (conservative for COTS 10 G optics).

Per-channel “effective MAC rate”: order-of-magnitude comparable to symbol rate when the loop implements an inner-layer matvec (feature extraction) with modest fan-in; we present ranges, not single points.

PUE: 1.2 (efficient) to 1.5 (typical) for datacenters; bench/rack optics assume local cooling ≈1.1–1.2 effective overhead.

Prices: eBay/secondary market for optics (SOA ~$0.6–1.5k; small EDFA ~$0.8–2k; 40ch DWDM mux/demux ~$100–250; drivers/photoreceivers few hundred to a couple thousand used). New lab-grade gear can be 2–5×. H100 pricing ranges as cited above. 
Uptime Institute

Scalability snapshots (co-processor doing inner layers)
1) MVP (1-λ, one-way, no loop)

CAPEX (used/surplus mix): $2k–$5k (laser/DFB, mod+driver, PD+TIA, small SOA or none, passive parts, DWDM odds).

Power (OPEX): 5–20 W (SOA-only) or 20–40 W with a small EDFA.

Throughput (order-of-mag): 10 Gsym/s → ~10 GMAC/s-equiv lane; useful for feature expansion / pre-conditioning.

Time-to-first-token: negligible pipeline latency (< µs fiber paths + analog read), but you still DMA to/from GPU/CPU.

Where it helps: cheap de-risking; measurable speedups on attention-KV projection or conv-like prefilters.

2) Tile (8-λ WDM, single loop)

CAPEX: $15k–$40k (8× SOA; 1–2 small EDFAs if needed; 40-ch DWDM pair; 8× PD+TIA; 1× mod stack; control).

Power: 60–200 W (SOA-only end vs EDFA-assisted end).

Throughput: ~0.1–0.4 TMAC/s-equiv (8×10 Gsym/s with ternary + loop reuse).

Latency: sub-µs per pass; multi-pass loop depth adds 10s–100s of ns.

Role: offload most matvec in inner MLP/attn blocks for mid-size models (7–70B) alongside a couple GPUs.

3) Stack (32-λ WDM or 8 λ × 4 modes/pols)

CAPEX: $60k–$150k (more channels, better drivers, instrumentation).

Power: 250–800 W (still a fraction of an 8×GPU server).

Throughput: ~0.5–2 TMAC/s-equiv.

Role: now competitive with a single H100 box on pure inner-layer math—while burning 2–5× less wall power for that portion. (Full pipeline still limited by digital I/O and non-offloaded ops.)

4) Rack (16 tiles; 256 λ aggregate)

CAPEX: $300k–$800k (depends heavily on how many parts you source used vs new).

Power: 4–12 kW optics side; effective PUE ~1.15–1.25 → 4.6–15 kW at the wall.

Throughput: ~8–32 TMAC/s-equiv for inner layers.

Comparator: a modern 8×H100 server is ~5–7 kW and $300k+; multi-server LLM nodes aggregate quickly to >30 kW per rack. On inner-layer math specifically, your optical rack aims for multi-× energy advantage at similar or lower CAPEX; system-level benefit depends on offload coverage and PCIe/NVLink plumbing. 
Uptime Institute

5) Room-scale cluster (8 racks) → “T-param capable”

Aim: cooperate with 10–50 GPUs for embedding/LM-head/optimizer while optics handles the majority of inner-layer FLOPs.

CAPEX: $2.5–$6 M optics + $0.5–$2 M GPUs/network.

Power: 40–120 kW optics + 0.3–1 MW GPUs depending on target throughput.

What “T-param capable” means here: enough inner-layer capacity to keep trillion-param models saturated at practical batch/seq when spread across GPU front/back ends (sharded KV/heads, optimizer states). Digital still gates context-length, routing, and training logistics; optics trims the OPEX of the math itself by ~10–100× on the part it owns, consistent with the AOC line of evidence when algorithms match hardware.

Energy & cost head-to-head (rules of thumb)
Thing	Optics (your tile)	GPU (single)
Capex	$15k–$40k (8-λ)	$25k–$40k per H100 (card only)
Power	60–200 W (tile)	700 W H100 SXM; 400 W A100
PUE adders	~1.1–1.2 bench/rack	1.2–1.5 DC average
Work fit	inner-layer matvec / fixed-point, reservoir	general LLM end-to-end
Energy per inner-layer MAC	target 10–100× lower than digital when tuned	baseline (normalized 1×)

How this maps to tokens/sec in practice

Digital ceiling: MLPerf inference with Blackwell B200 reported ~1,038 tok/s for a specific LLM setting (highly context/model dependent). That’s the “what good looks like” bar for a single top-end GPU today. 
Microsoft

Optical co-processor effect: think of 5–20× faster inner-layer turn (or 10–100× less energy) for that fraction of the pipeline that you offload. Net end-to-end gains of 1.5–5× are realistic at 8–32 λ when memory moves / attention wiring are still digital; ambitious co-design (more offload, fused analog steps, ternary-aware training) pushes higher. Microsoft’s AOC results back the magnitude on the right workloads; your ternary guardrails trade a bit of accuracy for simpler/cheaper parts. 
Computer Weekly

Where the economics flip

Sub-rack (≤32 λ): best J/MAC and $/MAC for specialized layers; you still need a GPU around to orchestrate.

Rack (≥256 λ): inner-layer math OPEX starts to dominate the savings; CAPEX competitive with 1–2 GPU servers, but better energy on the math you offload.

Room-scale (≥2 k λ aggregate): compelling LLM-per-watt if you keep PCIe/NVLink/NICs busy and minimize digital round-trips.

Practical constraints to bake into plans

Component power: small EDFA modules are ~10–20 W each (budget per channel if you need high OSNR); SOAs with TEC can be ~3–7 W worst-case. 
AusOptic

I/O pressure: PCIe/NVLink and DMA become your bottleneck; design the dataflow so that multiple loop passes amortize one host transfer.

Calibration drift & noise: set aside 1–5% duty for quick in-band calibration/AGC; expect OSNR and mode crosstalk budget.

Non-ideal ternary: quantization + SOA nonlinearity interacts with reservoir memory—co-train with your quantizer to keep accuracy.

Reality-check vs “replace the datacenter”

Microsoft’s group is careful: not general-purpose, but a widening swath of app classes benefit when the algorithm matches the physics. Their claim is ~100× energy at scale, not “100× tokens/sec across everything.” That’s the right way to frame your plan, too: own the energy and time on the math you offload, and let GPUs do what they’re great at. 
Computer Weekly

Quick sourcing anchors you can use while hunting parts

EDFA (bench/1U, +20–23 dBm): ~10–20 W power draw (FS example shown); used market $0.8–2k.

SOA (1550 nm, 14-pin butterfly): 10s–100s mA device current; TEC up to ~1.5 A → a few watts total; prices $0.6–1.5k used/new-old-stock. 
AusOptic

GPU baselines (power, price): A100/H100 TDP and H100 street prices as above. 
Uptime Institute

Datacenter PUE norms: 1.2 best-in-class to ~1.5 average.

AOC references: MS Research news & scale claims; early AIM blog for the fixed-point class they target. 
Computer Weekly
+1

What I’d put in the slide you show investors

Near-term (≤$40k, ≤200 W): 8-λ tile, 1–3× end-to-end speedup on targeted layers, 5–20× energy improvement on those layers, accuracy within quantized baselines.

12-month (≤$500k, ≤10 kW): rack with 8–32 TMAC/s-equiv inner-layer capacity; OPEX clearly below a comparable GPU rack for the same math.

24-month (multi-rack): co-designed training/inference with analog inner loops + digital front/back ends; room-scale for trillion-param workloads with optical kWh/token well under an all-GPU path (PUE-adjusted).

If you want, I can turn this into a little spreadsheet where you can tweak symbol rate, channels, EDFA counts, PUE, and power prices to get a live CAPEX/OPEX curve and a “tokens/sec” estimate for your favorite model.
