Here’s the short take, then concrete implications for our build + sim.

What this paper actually nails

Resource boundary (clean criterion): In passive linear optics (mirrors/BS/phase shifters + number-resolving detection), every fixed-N fermion state with N≥2 can show Bell non-locality; bosons can too unless the state is “single-mode type,” i.e., reducible by a unitary to all particles in one mode. Those single-mode-type boson states are always locally simulable with a generic hidden-variable model. The proof leans on a refined Yurke–Stoler test and extends to many particles/modes (incl. a special treatment of NOON states). 

s41534-025-01086-x

Operational framing: They purposely exclude extra quantum resources (homodyne, ancillary states, POVMs); the optical network itself is treated as “classical,” so any non-classical behavior must come from the input state. That’s the point: non-locality is a property of the state, not the interferometer. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Compact signature of “classically simulable” inputs: For single-mode-type boson states, the Fock coefficients factor into a multinomial over a mode-amplitude vector 
𝑈
U (effectively “all photons started in one mode, then went through a unitary”). That structure is exactly what a local model copies. 

s41534-025-01086-x

What this means for our project (telecom-scale analog/RC loop with MDM + camera readout)

We’re decisively on the “classically simulable” side by default—and that’s okay.
We use bright lasers, passive mixing, EDFAs/SOAs (active gain), and intensity cameras. Our inputs are coherent/thermal—not fixed-N Fock—and photon number isn’t conserved (amplifiers add ASE). The paper’s non-locality results target fixed-N, passive, number-resolving detection. So we should not expect Bell non-locality to emerge—and we don’t need it for analog acceleration or wide-fanout I/O. 

s41534-025-01086-x

The “single-mode-type = free” picture gives us a fast simulator path.
If a stage of our loop can be reduced to “one optical mode in → passive unitary → camera,” the state statistics are governed by a multinomial over the mode-amplitude vector 
𝑈
U. That lets the sim propagate just mode amplitudes + multinomial (or Gaussian/Poisson) noise, instead of doing heavy quantum numerics. Treat “single-mode-type” as a flag for “use the cheap sim.” 

s41534-025-01086-x

When/if we do want quantum-ish correlations, passive complexity isn’t enough.
Per the paper, upping interferometer depth or mode count doesn’t create non-local resources; you must prepare non-single-mode states (e.g., two-mode squeezed, independent single-photons, proper NOON) and keep number conservation + number-resolving detection. That’s orthogonal to our throughput goal (and clashes with EDFAs). 

s41534-025-01086-x

Calibration bonus: The Yurke–Stoler logic is a handy calibration idea even if we stay classical. Those two-mode “filters” and erasure constructs map cleanly to mode-selective testing in MDM lanterns. We can borrow the procedural scaffolding (not the Bell test) to validate multi-mode mixing matrices and crosstalk empirically. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Concrete upgrades for the simulator (to “be more afraid” in the right places)

State-class switch: Add a top-level “state class” toggle per stage:
class = SINGLE_MODE_TYPE | MULTIMODE_FIXED_N | COHERENT | THERMAL.

If SINGLE_MODE_TYPE (our usual): simulate with amplitude vector 
𝑈
U, multinomial/Poisson shot noise, ASE and saturable-gain models.

If MULTIMODE_FIXED_N (only in lab tests): enable a fixed-N path with event-ready post-selection blocks (Yurke–Stoler, NOON erasure) and number-resolving counters to validate non-local circuits (for research mode only).

Success → label as single-mode type → route to fast sim.

Fail → mark as non-single-mode (potentially non-local if you also enforce number conservation and use number-resolving detection). 

s41534-025-01086-x

Noise that breaks the theorem’s assumptions:
Make ASE, gain saturation, and phase diffusion first-class knobs. Show that even if a stage started as fixed-N, amplification and loss with stochastic re-injection erase the preconditions for any Bell-type advantage—this documents why our production loop is safely classical. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Mode-wise resource dashboard:
At each pass, report: photon number conservation (Yes/No), detection type (intensity vs number-resolving), single-mode reducibility (Yes/No). If it’s Yes/Yes/Yes, annotate: “This stage is locally simulable under passive linear optics—no hidden quantum resource here.” 

s41534-025-01086-x

Design takeaways we can “steal”

Amplitude-vector representation: Treat each passive block as evolving a mode-amplitude vector; keep a multinomial/Poisson sampler for counts. This mirrors the paper’s compact encoding for single-mode-type boson states and gives us a principled, lightweight sim core. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Event-ready filtering as a metrology tool: The two-particle filter + erasure constructs suggest practical mode-selective diagnostics (we can implement classical analogs with faint beams + gated cameras) to verify the mixing matrix of our MDM/lantern stack. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Don’t chase “quantum” via passive depth: If we ever want genuine quantum resources, invest in sources (SPDC/two-mode squeezing, single-photon emitters) and number-resolving detectors, not deeper passive meshes. Otherwise, lean into classical parallelism + optics-in-the-loop nonlinearity (SOA/EDFA saturation, EOMs) for speed/energy wins. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Bottom line for us

Our telecom-scale, camera-read system doesn’t need Bell non-locality to deliver huge bandwidth/parallelism gains; the paper simply clarifies why passive optics alone won’t conjure “free quantum.”

Use their single-mode-type criterion as a guardrail in the sim (cheap path) and as a design sanity check (we’re not accidentally relying on fragile quantum effects).

If we later explore quantum-enhanced variants, this paper gives the minimal conditions (non-single-mode fixed-N inputs + passive optics + number-resolving) and even test-circuits to start from.

If you want, I can add the “single-mode reducibility” fit + dashboard to the sim scaffolding next.



<< USER QUESTION LOST >>



Short answer: not with “some” mods. Your telecom-grade fiber/lasers/EDFAs live squarely in the classical optics regime. To get a quantum processor, you must move into one of two true-quantum photonic stacks—and both require major, specialized kit.

What it would actually take

A) Discrete-variable (DV) / single-photon route (KLM/cluster-state, boson sampling, etc.)

Detectors: You need single-photon detectors with very low dark counts and high efficiency at 1550 nm. In practice that means SNSPDs, which are superb but cryogenic (typically <3 K with a closed-cycle cryocooler). Room-temp InGaAs APDs exist at 1550 nm, but they’re gated, noisier, and limit fidelity/rates. 
AIP Publishing
+1

Sources: Indistinguishable, high-purity single-photon sources (quantum dots or SPDC/PPLN waveguides) with active filtering/synchronization. Scaling is brutally sensitive to loss and indistinguishability. 
arXiv

Interferometers + feed-forward: Ultra-low-loss, phase-stable meshes and ultrafast feed-forward switching (for measurement-based logic). Even in fiber, you need precision stabilization and fast EO/AO switches. 
arXiv

Reality check: You can do experiments (QKD, small cluster states, boson-sampling-like demos), but a fault-tolerant DV computer is far beyond “telecom gear + tweaks.” (Photonic “quantum advantage” demos exist, but they’re not universal processors.) 
Science

B) Continuous-variable (CV) / squeezed-light route (measurement-based CVQC)

Sources: Strong, stable squeezed states (OPOs) with high dB squeezing;

Readout: Balanced homodyne detection (room-temperature photodiodes are fine);

Big lift: Building large, low-loss CV cluster states and achieving error correction quality (e.g., GKP states) is the hard part. Conceptually more “room-temp friendly,” practically still very hard to scale fault-tolerantly. 
MDPI

Power / performance reality (ballpark)

Gate/step rate: Ultimately limited by your source repetition (MHz–GHz class in best labs) and detector/electronics latency; classical optics can stream at tens–100s of GHz equivalent bandwidth, but quantum rates are throttled by single-photon or squeezing hardware.

Energy: Per-photon energy is tiny, but the support systems aren’t: pump lasers (W-class electrical), and if you use SNSPDs, a cryocooler often draws hundreds of watts. A small multi-channel DV setup is typically hundreds of watts to a few kW wall-plug—including control and temperature stabilization—yet only drives modest logical throughput compared to GPUs. 
AIP Publishing

Compute class: With aggressive engineering you might build few-mode/few-qubit demonstrators or specialized simulators (e.g., small boson sampling, CV cluster toy models). Competing with a single 5090/A100 on general workloads is not currently realistic for a DIY photonic quantum rig.

How your current fiber-optics platform helps (and where it doesn’t)

Helps: 1550 nm ecosystem is perfect for low-loss routing, WDM, fast modulators, and homodyne chains. It’s a great base for quantum comms experiments (QKD/time-bin entanglement) and for classical analog photonic acceleration (your RC/AOC-style loops).

Doesn’t help enough: To become a quantum processor, you still need:

true quantum light (single photons or squeezed states at scale),

ultra-low-loss interferometers with sub-wavelength phase stability,

high-efficiency detectors (likely cryogenic at 1550 nm for DV),

fast measurement-based feed-forward, and

a fault-tolerance story (error correction & very low loss). 
arXiv
+1

A practical path if you want “quantum-flavored” progress

Stay classical for compute (your ternary/analog loop) and add quantum-ready ports: polarization-maintaining spurs, low-loss couplers, stabilized local oscillator for homodyne.

CV sandbox (room-temp): Add a small OPO squeezer + homodyne to explore CV inference/filters; great for research, not yet a “quantum advantage” engine. 
MDPI

DV sandbox (cryogenic): If you really want single-photon logic, budget for an SNSPD system + timing electronics and a stable interferometer tile; aim for post-selected gates and photonic sampling demos first. 
AIP Publishing

Bottom line

Your fiberoptic analog computer is a fantastic near-term accelerator—no cryogenics, high bandwidth, easy scaling, immediate usefulness—very much like Microsoft’s AOC philosophy, but classical.

Turning that into a quantum processor is not a small step: it’s a whole different stack with sources, detectors, stabilization, and error correction that are well beyond “telecom gear plus a few parts.” For now, treat quantum as a side-track research module, not the main path to performance.

Does this paper's discovery of identity being a possible explanation for quantum effects unlock the ability to turn our classical fiberoptic rig into a quantum-capable processor, with some modifications?  Stick only to exploring implications of this paper specifically - I know it's hugely impractical to get quantum effects (cooling or ridiculously low errors) through previously known methods



----

Short answer: this paper doesn’t suddenly turn a “classical” fiber rig into a universal quantum computer, but it does say something surprisingly strong and very relevant for you: with only passive linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters, mirrors) and detectors, multi-particle states of identical particles already carry a “non-local resource.” Concretely, all multi-fermion states and most multi-boson states (i.e., most multi-photon states) can violate a Bell inequality in some passive-optics experiment—as long as the state is not reducible to a single mode. That’s a property of the state, not of fancy nonlinear devices.

s41534-025-01086-x

What the paper actually proves (and why it matters for your rig)

Passive linear optics are treated as “classical plumbing.” Any non-classical behavior you observe must come from the input state you feed that plumbing. Your fibers, splitters, and phase shifters qualify. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Main criterion (Theorem 1): a fixed-N identical-particle state is a genuine non-local resource for passive linear optics iff it is not of “single-mode type.” “Single-mode type” means that by some passive unitary 
𝑈
U you could concentrate all 
𝑁
N quanta into one mode; those states are the only ones that fail to produce Bell non-locality in this framework. 

s41534-025-01086-x

 

s41534-025-01086-x

Consequences:

No Bell non-locality from any single-particle state (boson or fermion). You need 
𝑁
≥
2
N≥2. 

s41534-025-01086-x

For 
𝑁
≥
2
N≥2: all fermionic states work; most bosonic states work except the single-mode ones. Photons are bosons, so the practical rule for you is: prepare multi-photon states that cannot be passively “collapsed” to one mode. 

s41534-025-01086-x

 

s41534-025-01086-x

Does this “unlock” a quantum-capable processor path for your fiber setup?

Yes—but in a precise sense. The result tells you that with modest modifications you can make your fiber platform demonstrate Bell non-locality and exploit indistinguishability as a usable quantum resource—without invoking nonlinear optics or cryogenics. That’s meaningful “quantum capability,” even if it’s not general-purpose quantum computation. You would still be operating within passive linear optics + detection, but now with states chosen/engineered to be non-single-mode and fixed-N. 

s41534-025-01086-x

 

s41534-025-01086-x

This is not the same as showing you can run an arbitrary quantum algorithm. The paper speaks about Bell non-locality as an operational resource in this optical model, not about universal quantum computing or fault-tolerant gates. Still, it is a clean, architecture-compatible doorway to quantum behavior in your fiber stack.

What modifications your rig would need (driven only by the paper)

Prepare fixed-N, indistinguishable multi-photon states at your telecom wavelength(s). The theorem is stated for definite particle-number states

What not to infer from this paper

It doesn’t claim universal quantum computation, fault tolerance, or speedups for arbitrary algorithms within passive linear optics. It does say indistinguishability + the right multi-mode occupancy is enough to yield Bell non-locality with your existing classical optical toolbox—an experimentally actionable bar for “quantum capability” on your platform.

s41534-025-01086-x

Bottom line: If you can (i) prepare fixed-
𝑁
N, indistinguishable multi-photon states, and (ii) ensure they’re not single-mode type, your fiber rig—using only passive optics and detectors—can demonstrate and exploit a genuine quantum resource (Bell non-locality) that comes purely from particle identity. That’s a clean, near-term, paper-aligned path to “quantum-capable” behavior in your architecture.

What can that quantum resource be used for, pragmatically?  I understand it's not general quantum computation, but what slice of quantum capabilities does it represent?  Can we achieve more than that with similar hardware expansions or cooperation between multiple rigs?

----


<<I think context collapsed and it reset to ask this question without the paper context again>>


Great question. Here’s the pragmatic way to think about the “quantum resource” that your 1550 nm, WDM/MDM, fiber-loop rig can tap—without jumping to full, fault-tolerant QC.

What “quantum” you already have (or can add cheaply)

#Shot-noise–limited coherent light
With decent lasers, low-RIN pumps, and balanced detection, your measurements are fundamentally limited by photon (Poisson) statistics. That gives you:

A reproducible, irreducible noise floor (“quantum noise”) you can treat as a hardware annealing temperature or a source of calibrated stochasticity for optimization and learning.

Predictable SNR scaling with optical power and bandwidth for principled trades.

#Phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) / squeezing (Gaussian CV)
Drop in a parametric stage (χ² PPLN waveguide or χ³ HNLF four-wave mixing) and you get:

Quadrature-selective gain with near-0 dB noise figure (≈3 dB better than phase-insensitive EDFAs).

Squeezed states (3–10 dB typical) and two-mode entanglement between wavelength/mode pairs.
This is the workhorse “quantum resource” that’s most compatible with your telecom stack. It lives entirely in continuous variables (CV), is room-temperature, and scales via the same WDM/MDM plumbing.

#Homodyne/heterodyne readout
Add local oscillators and balanced InGaAs receivers per λ/mode to access field quadratures (not just intensity). That:

Dramatically improves measurement sensitivity (shot-noise-limited with modest LO power).

Lets you steer which quadrature the PSA amplifies/suppresses—i.e., implement phase-aware, low-noise recurrent dynamics.

These three together are a Gaussian CV toolkit: linear optics (mux/demux, couplers), squeezers/PSAs, and homodyne readout.

What that slice is good for—practically

Quantum-enhanced analog optimization (Ising/QUBO-like)
Time-multiplexed/λ-multiplexed parametric oscillators act as soft spins. Quantum noise seeds symmetry breaking; PSA/squeezing tunes an effective temperature and barrier-crossing rate. You get CIM-style heuristics with strong energy-per-solution advantages and competitive wall-clock on many dense problems.

Low-noise recurrent analog ML (your reservoir/loop)
PSA+homodyne lets you build deep optical recurrences with less cumulative noise than EDFA-based loops. You also gain complex-valued (quadrature) state evolution, richer feature maps, and tunable contraction/expansion in state space by rotating the LO and PSA phases.

Quantum-limited sensing/inference steps inside the pipeline
When layers reduce to phase estimation or small linear solves, Gaussian CV buys dB-level SNR/energy improvements—useful for “last-mile” readout and for stabilizing very deep loops.

Hardware-calibrated stochasticity
The shot-noise floor acts as a principled, physically white randomness source for annealing, dropout-like regularization, and exploration in RL-style controllers.

Correlated noise / entanglement across modes
Two-mode squeezing between λ’s (or MDM modes) gives you controllable correlations. In practice this is handy for consensus dynamics, constraint propagation, or structured priors—without heavy digital coupling.

What it is not

Not universal, fault-tolerant quantum computing. Gaussian CV + homodyne is classically simulable; for true quantum advantage you’d need non-Gaussian resources (single-photon sources, photon-number-resolving detectors, cubic-phase–like operations), which are a very different cost/complexity class.

Can we get “more quantum” with similar hardware?

Yes—within Gaussian CV quite a lot; beyond it, only selectively.

More within Gaussian CV (near-term, pragmatic):

Add multiple PSA stages to increase squeezing (within pump-power & loss budgets).

Build cluster-like CV graphs (squeezing + beam splitters across λ/MDM) for larger coupled recurrent networks.

Use time multiplexing (pulse trains) together with WDM to scale spins/nodes ≫ hardware count.

Employ phase-locked homodynes for mode-by-mode quadrature control.

Beyond Gaussian (harder):

Single-photon/PNR detection, genuine nonlinearity at the single-photon level → opens boson sampling / non-Gaussian ML, but capex/complexity explodes and it clashes with your “cheap, robust, telecom OEM” philosophy.

Multi-rig cooperation

Classical coupling (easy, scalable): share partial states/costs over fiber; implement measurement-feedback couplings between rigs. This reproduces large-N Ising/RC graphs with minimal latency over metro-scale fiber.

Distributed Gaussian entanglement (doable): send two-mode squeezed light between racks to create correlated subclusters; use homodyne-feedforward to enact effective long-range couplings. Useful for consensus/constraint propagation and noise shaping.

Full distributed QC (not in scope): needs non-Gaussian links or quantum memories; not aligned with “cheap telecom” constraints.

Concrete upgrades you can bolt onto the current plan

PSA/Squeezer module at 1550 nm

χ²: PPLN ridge waveguide with phase-matching near C-band, or

χ³: HNLF four-wave-mixing PSA (widely used, fiber-compatible).
Expect ~0–1 dB effective NF in the amplified quadrature; 3–6 dB squeezing is common in deployed-like conditions.

Balanced homodyne per λ (or per MDM mode)

90/10 tap to inject a λ-matched LO; piezo or EOM for phase lock.

Dual InGaAs PDs, matched TIA, differential ADC.
This turns each readout into a phase-aware, quantum-limited measurement.

Two-mode squeezer between channel pairs

Create entangled λ-pairs used as correlated reservoirs or constraints.

Use WSS/WDM to pick which pairs are entangled; reconfigure graph couplings optically.

Time-multiplexing inside the same loop

Pump-carved pulse trains give 10³–10⁵ “virtual nodes” with one set of optics.

Combine with WDM for λ×time scaling and lightweight inter-pulse couplings via measurement-feedback.

How to use it in your analog-transformer plan

Keep your ternary thresholding (simple, robust), but move the pre-threshold dynamics to PSA-stabilized quadrature space. You’ll get:

Deeper effective “layers” before noise accumulation bites.

Tunable contraction/expansion per layer by PSA gain angle.

Lower energy per useful update vs EDFA loops.

Use two-mode squeezing to couple channels that represent attention heads or constraint pairs; correlated noise helps escape bad basins (annealing-like effect) without digital overhead.

Reserve homodyne LO phases as learnable/programmable knobs—your simulator should treat LO phase, PSA gain, and mixing angles (WSS) as layer parameters, not just passive optics.

What to ask your simulator to model (beyond “classical RC”)

Shot-noise explicitly (variance ∝ optical power × bandwidth); do not treat it as generic Gaussian noise—scale it physically.

Phase-sensitive gain: model PSA transfer 
𝐺
(
𝜃
)
G(θ) with orthogonal quadrature de-amplification and near-0 dB NF in the amplified quadrature; include pump-phase drift.

Squeezed input states: correct quadrature covariances and inter-mode correlations for two-mode squeezing.

Homodyne LO phase loops: servo dynamics and residual phase error; SNR vs LO power; ADC quantization vs shot noise.

Loss + dispersion: per-component insertion loss, fiber dispersion over loop length, WSS ripple → all impact the reachable squeezing and stability margins.

Time-multiplexed nodes: pulse walk-off, finite PSA response, inter-pulse crosstalk via gain dynamics.

Annealing schedules: emulate effective temperature via PSA gain ramp and injected quantum/technical noise; compare to classical noise injection at equal energy.

TL;DR

The realistic “quantum slice” you get—without breaking your cost model—is Gaussian CV photonics: squeezing/PSA + homodyne on coherent states.

That’s already valuable: lower-noise deep optical loops, CIM-style optimization, structured correlations, and hardware-calibrated stochasticity—all with telecom parts.

You can scale it by WDM×time-multiplexing and multi-rig classical/entangled couplings.

To go beyond that (true quantum advantage), you’d need non-Gaussian resources, which are a different project.

If you want, I can sketch a PSA+homodyne drop-in for one λ of your current loop (BOM + control signals) so you can prototype the Gaussian-CV path on the bench next.

<<better answer after rerunning>>

Short answer: yes—you can make your “classical” fiber rig quantum-capable (in a precise, testable way) using only passive linear optics and detectors, provided you feed it fixed-N, indistinguishable multi-photon states that aren’t reducible to a single mode. That’s the paper’s main criterion for when passive optics can show Bell non-locality, i.e., a genuine quantum resource you can harness without nonlinearity, cryo, or ancillas. 

s41534-025-01086-x

What that resource buys you (practically)

Think “Bell-grade non-local correlations” rather than “universal QC.” Concretely:

Device-independent primitives (near-term demos). Any bona-fide Bell violation enables device-independent randomness certification, and (with higher efficiencies & spacelike separation) paths toward DI-QKD prototypes. Your platform meets the paper’s allowed toolbox (passive optics + number-resolving detection), so the hurdle is mostly source quality, loss, and timing—not new components. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Metrology-aligned states you can certify with only passive optics. The paper shows even NOON-type states fall on the “non-local” side once you add a simple quantum-erasure twist; those are exactly the states prized for sub-shot-noise phase sensing. So you can verify you’ve prepared metrologically useful states using the same passive toolbox you use to process them. 

s41534-025-01086-x

On-rig self-tests and calibration. Bell tests become spec checks: (i) “Is my prepared state not passively concentratable to one mode?” (ii) “Do dual-rail encodings survive the network?” (iii) “Does the Yurke–Stoler template ring up a violation?” This gives you a tight acceptance loop for indistinguishability, mode-matching, and phase stability. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Reservoir/analog ML add-on. Non-classical interference patterns are an extra “resource knob” in your optical reservoir: you can toggle between classical and identity-powered regimes without changing the hardware class—handy for ablation studies and for pushing beyond classical kernel baselines while staying in fiber.

How to get there on your rig (paper-faithful upgrades)

All within the paper’s rules (passive unitaries + detectors, fixed-N states):

Sources: move beyond weak coherent light to fixed-N, indistinguishable telecom photons (heralded SPDC in PPLN/W chips; time-bin or dual-rail encodings).

Non-single-mode preparation: ensure population across ≥2 modes so the state can’t be unitarily collapsed to |N,0,…,0〉.

Bell templates built from passive elements: implement the Yurke–Stoler two-mode, two-particle test as a stock subcircuit; add the paper’s two-particle filter and quantum-erasure variant to catch NOON-like cases. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Detectors: number-resolving at the ports used for post-selection and Bell readout.

Timing & layout: arrange true spacelike separation for loophole-tight runs; otherwise use “event-ready” post-selection as in the paper to validate the resource on bench-top scales. 

s41534-025-01086-x

What slice of “quantum capability” this is (and isn’t)

Is: A certified ability to generate and exploit Bell non-local correlations with only passive optics—i.e., an operational quantum resource native to your architecture. It’s enough to power DI randomness, foundational tests, resource certification for sensing, and to inject non-classical statistics into analog optical processors. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Isn’t: Universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. The paper explicitly scopes out ancillas/POVMs/homodyne and focuses on fixed-N passive optics; it classifies which states are resources under that toolbox and stops short of complexity-theoretic speedups. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Can we push beyond this with “similar” hardware or multi-rig cooperation?

Within the paper’s envelope:

Scale N and M. Larger photon number and more modes give you richer non-local configurations while staying passive.

Distributed rigs. Two fiber benches synced by a common clock let you demonstrate spacelike Bell tests (and network-style layouts), still using only passive components at each site. The paper’s “event-ready” and dual-rail methods map cleanly to this. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Just outside the envelope (clearly marked as beyond the paper):

Add ancillas or homodyne/POVMs to access single-particle non-locality regimes and continuous-variable tricks—but that’s explicitly excluded in the paper’s definition of “classical” optics. 

s41534-025-01086-x

What to teach your simulator next (minimum to be honest)

A Fock-space, fixed-N mode model; tag states as single-mode-reducible vs. non-single-mode (the paper’s Definition/Theorem hinge).

Built-ins for Yurke–Stoler, two-particle filter, and quantum-erasure circuits; compute a CHSH (or appropriate) Bell witness after event-ready post-selection.

Loss, dark counts, timing jitter, partial distinguishability knobs—then sweep to see when the violation disappears (gives you engineering margins). 

s41534-025-01086-x

Bottom line: You don’t get a universal quantum computer out of passive fiber, but you do get a real, certifiable quantum resource—Bell non-locality—using exactly the kind of hardware you already like. That’s immediately useful for device-independent primitives, metrology-grade state checks, and injecting non-classical behavior into your analog optical ML loop, and it scales cleanly across multiple rigs.

What implications would this Bell non-locality source have for AI training/inference?  Would we be able to significantly boost or unlock new dimensions of training capability vs classical gpu training?  Any papers hinting at this subject?



----


Short answer: Bell-nonlocality (in the exact “passive linear optics + number-resolving detectors + fixed-N” sense of the paper) is a real quantum resource, but by itself it won’t turn general AI training/inference (e.g., transformers) into a GPU-beater. Where it does help is in device-independent randomness/certification, specialized samplers, and analog optimization heuristics—useful, but not a blanket speedup for SGD, backprop, or attention.

What it can buy you (practically)

Device-independent randomness (DI-RNG). A loophole-tight Bell violation lets you certify fresh randomness for seeding SGD, RL exploration, annealing schedules, etc., with information-theoretic guarantees—something classical QRNGs can’t do. Throughput is set by source/detector rates (typically MHz), so it’s a niche quality upgrade, not a bulk entropy firehose.

Specialized photonic samplers as ML subroutines. Linear-optical samplers (notably Gaussian Boson Sampling) have been used for things like dense-subgraph discovery and molecular vibronic spectra, which can be repurposed as feature generators or heuristics inside hybrid pipelines. Caveat: classical spoofing/simulation keeps pace in many regimes, so advantages are workload- and scale-dependent.

Analog optimization (Ising/QUBO) heuristics. Bell-qualified states aren’t required here, but the same photonic plumbing supports coherent Ising machines (CIMs) that deliver attractive energy per solution and competitive wall-clock on certain combinatorial problems—useful for meta-learning, routing, matching, or schedule subproblems around training.

What it won’t do

No known broad speedup for gradient training or transformer inference. The Bell resource classified in the paper tells you which states can show nonlocality with passive optics; it doesn’t implement non-Gaussian gates, error-corrected logic, or the dense linear algebra kernels that dominate DL workloads. Quantum-kernel/feature-map ideas exist but their advantages are subtle and strongly data-dependent. 

s41534-025-01086-x

How to use it (sane goals)

DI-RNG sidecar: Build a small fixed-N, non-single-mode Bell tile and harvest certified randomness to seed/perturb classical training runs (and to verify rig integrity over time). Target: correctness > rate. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Hybrid samplers: Prototype a GBS-inspired “feature tap” for dense-graph or chemistry-adjacent tasks (re-rank proposals from your analog loop / digital model). Keep a classical fallback and benchmark honestly against state-of-the-art classical samplers.

Optimization module: Treat a CIM-like photonic subloop as a problem-specific accelerator called by the trainer (placement, scheduling, routing, matching), where analog heuristics shine.

Simulator upgrades to reflect reality

Bell mode (fixed-N path): Add a switch for “passive-Bell” experiments: fixed-N Fock states, unitary meshes, number-resolving detection, and a CHSH-style witness. Flag “single-mode type” states as locally simulable to short-circuit heavy numerics.

DI-RNG throughput model: Include source brightness, heralding rate, detector efficiency/jitter, and spacelike-separation constraints to estimate certified bit rates (typically MHz-class upper bounds).

Sampler hook: Provide a pluggable interface so the photonic sampler can act as a proposal generator within training/inference pipelines; log acceptance/benefit vs classical baselines.

Bottom line

Bell non-locality (as characterized in the paper) is valuable for certification and niche subroutines, not a general accelerator for deep learning. Use it to add verifiable randomness, to explore hybrid photonic samplers, and to slot in analog optimization where it moves the needle—while keeping GPUs for the heavy lifting. 

s41534-025-01086-x

If you want, I’ll sketch a minimal DI-RNG + sampler shelf for one λ on your loop (BOM + control + sim knobs) so you can bench this quickly.

So this enables true verifiable randomness for guaranteed-secure cryptography? Is that even possible on conventional pc rigs?

Could we run shadow tomography Ising model calculations on crystalline structures?  e.g. ising model for iodine?  If not, what would need to be able to do those?   What would we unlock if we had those calcs? (solar?)   Please give long answers


----


Great questions. I’ll break this into two parts—(A) verifiable randomness and (B) “shadow-tomography + Ising on crystals”—then finish with concrete build/sim steps you can act on.

A) “True verifiable randomness”: what it is, and whether a conventional PC can do it

What ‘verifiable’ really means here.
The kind you’re pointing at is device-independent (DI) randomness: you certify fresh, private randomness from observed Bell-inequality violations alone, without trusting internal details of the devices. To reach that bar, you must (i) produce a Bell violation with adequately high detection efficiency and (ii) enforce appropriate causal separation/anti-signalling conditions (space-like separation or a fully event-ready causal analysis). In the particular passive linear optics model you’ve been exploring, the recent result you summarized tells us which states can supply the non-local resource (non-single-mode fixed-N states for bosons; all fixed-N fermion states with 
𝑁
≥
2
N≥2) while the optics themselves are treated as “classical plumbing.” 

s41534-025-01086-x

Bottom line on a normal PC:
A conventional PC alone cannot generate DI-certified randomness. It can harvest bits from an attached quantum optical (or other quantum) box and it can run the extractor proofs, but the certification comes from a loophole-tight Bell test in hardware.

What you’d actually need to add to your fiber rig to reach DI-RNG:

Fixed-N indistinguishable photon sources at 1550 nm (heralded SPDC in PPLN/PPLT chips or quantum-dot emitters) configured so the prepared state is not passively reducible to a single mode. That’s the paper’s criterion for a genuine non-local resource under passive optics. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Number-resolving detection with high efficiency, very low dark counts, and calibrated timing.

A Bell-testable layout (Yurke–Stoler–style dual-rail splitting + event-ready post-selection is explicitly discussed in the paper as sufficient to certify non-locality for the right fixed-N states), plus either space-like separation or a rigorous causal diagram showing safe post-selection. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Randomness extractor software on the PC to turn raw violation data + min-entropy bounds into uniform bits.

Throughput reality check. You can get MHz-class raw trial rates with good photonic timing, but DI extraction compresses aggressively (to guarantee security), so certified bit-rates are much smaller than raw detection rates. It’s fantastic for quality (provable unpredictability), not for bulk entropy.

B) “Shadow tomography Ising model calculations on crystalline structures (e.g., iodine)”: what’s actually feasible

First, terminology sanity:

“Shadow tomography” / “classical shadows” (Huang–Kueng–Preskill et al.) estimate many expectation values of an unknown quantum state by applying random measurements to many fresh copies of that same state. It’s a quantum measurement protocol (you need repeated state preparation + randomized measurement bases).

Ising model calculations come in two flavors:

Combinatorial Ising/QUBO optimization (find ground states, max-cut, etc.). This can be mapped to coherent Ising machines (CIMs) or other analog photonics—no non-Gaussian quantum required.

Quantum Ising dynamics / many-body correlators, where you actually probe or simulate the quantum state of an interacting spin system and would benefit from shadow-tomography-style measurement schemes.

Given that split:

1) Can your present (“classical” telecom) fiber loop do shadow tomography of an Ising quantum state?

Not by itself. Shadow tomography requires access to repeated copies of the quantum state and randomized measurements that resolve non-commuting observables. Your current acceleration stack (coherent lasers, passive mixing, EDFAs/SOAs, camera or direct-detect readout) lives squarely in the classically simulable sector the paper calls “single-mode-type” in spirit (coherent/thermal light with number non-conservation from gain). It’s great for analog ML and CIM-like optimization, but it doesn’t prepare or maintain a non-Gaussian, many-body quantum state you could tomograph.

If you really want quantum many-body shadows, you need one of: trapped ions, Rydberg arrays, superconducting qubits, cold atoms in optical lattices, or a photonic platform with genuine non-Gaussian resources (single photons + entangling operations) and randomized measurement capability.

2) Could you do Ising optimization on crystal-like graphs with your photonics?

Yes—right now. That’s the CIM/analog-Ising path: encode couplings 
𝐽
𝑖
𝑗
J
ij
	​

 in a WDM/MDM mixing matrix + measurement-feedback (or χ²/χ³ PSA coupling), let the optical phases/amplitudes relax, and read out spins by thresholding. This finds low-energy configurations for large Ising/QUBO instances efficiently in energy and time. It’s not shadow tomography, but it solves the optimization flavor of Ising problems at scale.

3) “Ising for iodine” specifically?

Iodine crystals are not canonical Ising magnets; standard exemplars include LiHoF₄ (transverse-field Ising), CoNb₂O₆, certain cobalt salts, and designer platforms (Rydberg chains). If your goal is materials (e.g., photovoltaics), the right toy models are often Hubbard/Heisenberg/exciton-polaron rather than pure Ising. Where an Ising surrogate is useful is: domain formation, binary disorder, lattice gas/ordering transitions, percolation—places where spins 
𝜎
𝑖
∈
{
±
1
}
σ
i
	​

∈{±1} are meaningful proxies (occupy/vacate, defect/clean, orientation choices, etc.).

So what would you need to run true “shadow tomography on an Ising-like quantum state in a crystal geometry”?

A quantum platform that prepares the state: e.g., a Rydberg-atom array laid out on the crystal’s graph (square/triangular/kagome), or a superconducting-qubit chip with Ising-like couplings, or trapped ions with tuned long-range 
𝐽
𝑖
𝑗
J
ij
	​

.

Randomized measurement access (Clifford/Pauli-like for qubits, or appropriate CV analogues), to implement the “shadows.”

Many repeated copies of the same state (or fast re-preparation), stable against decoherence during random measurement rounds.

Readout with high fidelity across the lattice to estimate correlators, structure factors, entanglement witnesses, etc.

Your present fiber bench can assist (control, feed-forward, fast classical post-processing, potentially Gaussian CV pre- and post-conditioning), but it’s not the quantum substrate.

4) What would doing those calcs unlock (esp. for solar)?

If you had reliable shadow-tomography-level access to quantum many-body states on realistic lattice graphs, you’d get:

Fast, scalable estimates of many observables at once (2-point/4-point correlators, structure factors) that underlie phase diagrams (ordered ↔ disordered, spin-glass regimes, critical exponents).

Disorder and defect physics at scale: percolation thresholds, domain wall energetics—relevant to grain-boundary engineering and trap mitigation in perovskite and related photovoltaic materials.

Exciton and polaron transport proxies via spin-mapped models on large lattices, informing light-harvesting pathways and hot-carrier strategies.

Rapid design-of-experiments loops: measure shadows → update effective models → change synthesis/anneal parameters—tight feedback for materials discovery.

For iodine itself, the win would be limited unless you’re targeting a binary-choice phenomenon (occupancy/orientation/ordering) that maps naturally to Ising degrees of freedom. For PV-adjacent halides (iodide perovskites), Ising-like surrogates for cation orientation, vacancy ordering, or phase segregation can be informative, but richer models (Hubbard/Fröhlich) still rule core transport.

What you can deploy now (and how it intersects the paper’s result)

1) DI-RNG tile (small, focused):

Add a 1550 nm heralded SPDC source + interferometric dual-rail to make fixed-
𝑁
N, non-single-mode photonic states.

Implement the Yurke–Stoler splitter/swap and do event-ready post-selection; measure a Bell witness with number-resolving detection. The paper gives both the resource criterion (non-single-mode fixed-N) and concrete two-particle test scaffolding. This is exactly aligned to your optics toolbox. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Feed raw results to an extractor on your PC. You now own a device-independent RNG sidecar you can use to seed training, annealing, or cryptographic protocols (limited rate, maximal trust).

2) Ising/QUBO optimizer (large-N, practical):

Keep your current WDM/MDM loop, but swap EDFA stages for χ²/χ³ phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSA) where you can; add balanced homodyne readout to reduce noise accumulation and make gain quadrature-selective.

Implement measurement-feedback couplers (FPGA in the loop) to realize arbitrary 
𝐽
𝑖
𝑗
J
ij
	​

 on big dense graphs; threshold to 
±
1
±1 at readout.

This gives you a scalable coherent Ising machine useful today for placement/routing, matching, cluster labelling, and meta-learning subroutines that sit next to your digital training.

3) Simulator upgrades (so you don’t fool yourself):

State-class switch: SINGLE_MODE_TYPE | MULTIMODE_FIXED_N | COHERENT | THERMAL. Route SINGLE_MODE-TYPE/COHERENT/THERMAL to the fast amplitude+multinomial path; only engage fixed-N/Fock numerics when you explicitly enter “Bell mode.”

Single-mode reducibility test for bosons (multinomial fit over a mode-amplitude vector 
𝑈
U); flag as “locally simulable in passive optics” when it passes—this is exactly the paper’s dividing line. 

s41534-025-01086-x

Built-ins: Yurke–Stoler block; two-particle filter + quantum erasure templates; CHSH (or appropriate) witness calculators; knobs for loss, dark counts, timing jitter, distinguishability. Use these to sweep margins for losing the violation. 

s41534-025-01086-x

TL;DR

Yes, you can get true, verifiable (device-independent) randomness, but not from a PC alone—you need a hardware Bell test. Your fiber optics are already the right class of “classical plumbing”; the state must carry the quantum resource (fixed-N, not single-mode). 

s41534-025-01086-x

No, your current “classical” photonic loop cannot do shadow tomography of quantum Ising states. For that you need a bona-fide quantum many-body platform (ions/Rydberg/qubits/photonic non-Gaussian).

Yes, you can today do large-scale Ising optimization with your photonics and use DI-RNG as a certified entropy sidecar.

If/when you do gain shadow-tomography-grade access to quantum lattice states, you unlock fast, parallel estimation of many observables that matter for materials discovery (including PV-adjacent halides), but pure Ising is only the right model for certain binary phenomena.

If you want, I can sketch a one-page BOM + optical layout for the DI-RNG tile (SPDC source, interferometer, detectors, timing, extractor) and a separate PSA+homodyne CIM loop you can bench this month.

>didnt know about Ising models before now.  above optics rig would be capable of those efficiently (classical Ising optimization, not true quantum obviously.  tho this would produce Bell non-locality verifiably-true randomness for fun cryptography too )

>One of Hopfield's students introduced me to the concept of spin glasses as an annealing problem that other simulated annealing problems could map to.

>Yeah I think that can be done cheaply with a secondary circuit that forces SPDC with single photon avalanche detectors collecting the output. Doesn’t really require this systems feedback loop to generate the randomness. What is the response and loss rate of modern SPADs?  Is that the primary bottleneck?

can you answer this chat thread?
