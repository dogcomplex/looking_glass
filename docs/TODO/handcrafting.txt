esoteric question:  how impossible would each component in our optical rig be to recreate with hand tools, relatively commonly-available chips and resources, and a highly-intelligent, highly-dexterous robot?
Thought for 34s

Love this question. Here’s a pragmatic “how-hard-is-it-to-recreate” map of the main parts in your 1550 nm, multi-λ, all-optical loop—assuming: hand tools, modest benchtop gear, common COTS chips, lots of surplus telecom, and one very smart, very dexterous robot.

Legend:

✅ doable with benchtop tools + surplus

⚠️ possible but painful / specialized gear helps

❌ basically requires a fab or exotic materials

Sources & gain

DFB/EML 1550 nm lasers (in TOSA/SFP/SFP+) — Recreate? Extract from surplus transceivers: ✅ (robot helps with delicate desolder/rework). Build from scratch? ❌ (epitaxy, gratings).
Tip: salvage DFBs + pigtails; reuse the built-in isolator when possible.

Tunable C-band lasers (XFP/SFP+ DWDM) — Reuse modules? ✅ (control via MDIO/I²C). Build tunability? ❌ (integrated heaters/etalon).

SOA (semiconductor optical amplifier) — From die? ⚠️ (needs precise coupling + TEC + wire-bond). Fabricate? ❌ (III–V epitaxy).

EDFA (erbium fiber amplifier) — Assemble module? ⚠️ (buy Er-doped fiber, 980/1480 nm pumps, WDMs, isolators; fuse/splice; needs a good fusion splicer). Make Er fiber? ❌.

Modulation / nonlinearity

LiNbO₃ Mach-Zehnder modulators — Home-build? ❌. Reuse used parts? ✅ (control Vπ with RF driver).

Electro-absorption modulators — Reuse? ⚠️ (inside EML packages). Fabricate? ❌.

Saturable/nonlinear fiber elements (HNLF, NLPF, NOLM) — Assemble? ⚠️ (needs precise loop lengths/splices; robot helps). Fabricate fiber? ❌.

Wavelength / mode handling

WDM mux/demux (AWG/PLC, thin-film filters) — DIY? AWG/PLC ❌; thin-film stacks ❌; buy surplus? ✅.

Circulators / isolators — DIY? ❌ (magneto-optic crystals + sub-µrad alignment). Buy surplus? ✅.

Couplers/splitters (fused biconical taper) — DIY with fusion splicer + microheater? ⚠️ doable; buy? ✅ cheap.

Photonic lantern (MDM fan-in/out) — DIY (heat-and-pull in capillary, robot aligns fibers)? ⚠️ hard but hobby-lab plausible with patience; buy? ✅.

Mode scramblers / few-mode fiber — Buy? ✅; DIY tapering? ⚠️.

Switching / attenuation / control

MEMS fiber switches (1×N) — DIY? ❌; buy surplus? ✅.

VOA (microbend/mechanical) — DIY? ✅ (microbend jig with stepper); integrated VOA? ❌.

Polarization controllers (fiber squeezer loops) — DIY? ✅ (3-paddle squeezer with servo); PM splicing ⚠️.

TEC control, laser current drivers, PIDs — DIY analog/digital? ✅ (off-the-shelf driver ICs; robot can assemble fine-pitch).

Detection / readout

InGaAs photodiodes (discrete) — Buy? ✅ (packaged). Die + wire-bond? ⚠️ (robot helps). Fabricate? ❌.

TIAs / ADCs — DIY? ✅ (RF layout care).

InGaAs line/area cameras — Build from sensor? ⚠️ (hard); buy used? ✅; Si barcode/CMOS at 1550 nm? ❌ (wrong band).

Fiberwork & mechanics

Splicing / connectorization (LC/APC, PM) — With used fusion splicer? ✅; by hand polishing? ⚠️ (slow, but possible).

FBGs (Bragg gratings) — Write your own? ❌ without UV laser + phase mask + H₂ loading; buy? ✅.

Precision opto-mechanics (stages, holders) — 3D-print + metal shop? ✅ (robot great at repeatable alignment).

What your robot materially changes

Safe laser/TOSA extraction, re-pigtailing, and sub-micron butt-coupling to chips.

Repeatable fusion splicing, tapered coupler/lantern pulls.

Fine wire-bonding for bare SOA/PD dies (if you go that route).

High-throughput polishing of APC ferrules (consistent 8° geometry).

Automated alignment/locking of free-space benches (if you hybridize).

Red / Yellow / Green list

GREEN (build/assemble in a garage): drivers, TEC/PIDs, VOAs (mechanical), fiber couplers (buy or DIY), polarization controllers, surplus WDMs/circulators, fusion splicing/connectorization, EDFA assembly from bought Er-fiber + pumps, servo’d benches, control firmware.

YELLOW (robot helps; still touchy): photonic lanterns, NOLM fiber loops, PM splicing, bare-die SOA/PD packaging, compact ruggedized modules, multi-λ timing/sync backplanes, analog front-end RF boards (low-noise TIAs).

RED (don’t try to fabricate): laser/PD/SOA chips, LiNbO₃/PLC/AWG/isolators at component level, FBG writing, high-quality thin-film filters.

Two realistic “from-scratchish” paths

Surplus-centric 1550 nm fiber rack (your plan):
Buy DFBs/EDFAs/WDMs/isolators/switches as modules. You (and the robot) do the system-level integration, splicing, packaging, calibration, and control. This is the fastest route to a serious, stable multi-λ loop.

Free-space 850–940 nm MVP:
DMD/SLM + lenses + Si machine-vision camera for one-pass readout; add loop with fast EO modulator if desired. Uses cheap parts, showcases wide-fanout readout, teaches control—then port the architecture to 1550 nm fiber.

Where hand-crafted wins vs. buy

Wins: custom photonic lantern geometries, micro-mechanical VOAs/scramblers, bespoke packaging, multi-module orchestration (your “co-processor” personality), swappable loop topologies.

Buy: anything that required epitaxy, crystal growth, wafer-level lithography, or magneto-optics.

Feasibility snapshot (months, not years)

Week 1–4: bench power/TEC/current control + single-λ DFB path, PD+TIA readout, closed-loop PID, basic WDM plumbing.

Month 2–3: 4–8 λ mux/demux, polarization control, microbend VOA, EDFA integration, stability scripts.

Month 3–6: MDM fan-in/out trial (buy one; attempt one DIY taper), MEMS 1×N switching, multi-λ timing, ternary thresholding & analog loop.

Safety & sanity

1550 nm is “invisible” but still Class 3B/4 dangerous—always APC connectors, shutters, and interlocks.

Fiber shards are nasty—dedicated mats and disposal.

Thermal runaway: current drivers must have fast hardware limits + TEC interlocks.

Bottom line

You can assemble a highly capable multi-λ 1550 nm optical co-processor almost entirely from surplus and COTS—hand tools + good splicer + your robot.

You cannot realistically fabricate the active photonic chips or nonreciprocal parts. That’s fine: your moat is system engineering, not chip growth.

If you ever want a “purely hand-made” flex: photonic lanterns, VOAs, custom fiber couplers, and rugged packaging are the sweet spot for craft + robotics.
