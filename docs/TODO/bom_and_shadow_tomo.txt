awesome—here’s a clean, end-to-end recap of the fiber-optic build using full component names. I’ve split it into (A) the single-channel, one-way MVP you’ll build first, and (B) the 8-wavelength recirculating loop you’ll scale into. After each BoM, you’ll find a numbered signal path that shows how light moves through every block.

MVP signal path (one-way)

1. DFB Laser Diode → Laser Diode Current Controller + TEC Temperature Controller
Stable CW output at 1550 nm with low RIN and locked wavelength via temperature.


2. Laser Output → Fiber-Optic Isolator (1550 nm)
Protects source; keeps reflections out.


3. Isolator → Variable Optical Attenuator
Sets the reservoir input power / operating point.


4. VOA → Polarization Controller
Tunes SOP to maximize SOA nonlinearity / desired mixing response.


5. Polarization Controller → Mixing Network (50:50 couplers + optional few-mode/graded-index fiber segment)
Passive linear mixing / path diversity; creates a richer “reservoir state.”


6. Mixer → Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA)
Provides saturable gain nonlinearity (key to ternary/low-precision behavior).
Followed by Post-SOA Isolator for stability.


7. SOA Output → 99:1 (or 95:5) Tap Coupler
Small fraction to detector; the rest can go to dump (MVP) or into future loop hardware.


8. Tap → InGaAs Photodiode Receiver (with TIA) → (optional RF filter) → High-Speed ADC
Produces your analog feature vector (digitized), which the Digital Control Computer uses for last-layer decoding/regression.



(That’s your minimal proof that “optical reservoir + ternary readout” works at C-band. From here, you either add the loop or add more wavelengths.)

Eight-λ loop signal path (recirculating)

Launch & combine

1. Eight DFB/Tunable Laser Diodes (with current + TEC control) → each through Isolator → VOA → Polarization Controller.


2. Eight conditioned wavelengths → DWDM Multiplexer → Combined Multi-λ Fiber.

7) In-Loop VOA → Recirculation Delay Line (fiber spool defines round-trip time / effective layer depth).
8) Delay Line → 1×2 Coupler:

Tap Arm (1–5%) → DWDM Demultiplexer → 8× InGaAs Photodiode Receivers → Multi-Channel ADC → Digital Last-Layer.

Through Arm (95–99%) → back to Mixing Network to complete the loop.


Injection / reset (optional) 9) Injection Coupler (before or after the mixer) accepts a gated input burst or pilot tone per λ.
10) Electro-Optic Modulator (optional) can inject phase/intensity perturbations for control or learning signals.

Notes, options, and practical guidance

Connectors: Prefer FC/APC for all analog compute paths (low back-reflection). Use LC/UPC only where a module forces it; adapt with FC/APC↔LC/UPC hybrid jumpers.

SOA choice: A C-band butterfly SOA (tens of mA to ~200 mA bias) gives your nonlinearity and per-round-trip gain; set operating point with VOAs. (Your InPhenix IPSAD15xx-series device fits.)

EDFA vs SOA: An Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier is great for bulk gain but is less “sharp” as the nonlinear activation and adds more ASE noise; keep the SOA as the main nonlinearity and use an EDFA only if you must recover loss in long loops.

Mixing richness: A little few-mode/graded-index fiber or a deeper coupler lattice noticeably improves “feature explosion” before the SOA.

Polarization: SOAs and many passive parts are polarization sensitive; use polarization controllers (or PM versions of parts) to stabilize operating points.

Scaling: Add wavelengths by replicating the per-λ front-end (Isolator + VOA + PC), feeding the same DWDM MUX and shared loop. Add detectors by replicating DEMUX + PD + ADC channels.

MDM/camera branch (optional): If you later try photonic-lantern + InGaAs area camera readout, add a Photonic Lantern (SM→Few-Mode) and InGaAs Area Camera after a tap; this replaces the DEMUX + PD bank for a high-fan-out spatial read but costs more.

2. Add pre-isolator → VOA → PC, confirm stable launch power and SOP.


3. Insert the mixer (couplers + optional few-mode fiber), measure insertion loss and speckle stability.


4. Insert the SOA with post-isolator; set bias to desired nonlinearity region; verify no lasing/oscillation.


5. Add tap → PD → ADC, capture MVP data and train a digital readout to confirm usable features.


6. When happy, add loop elements: in-loop VOA, fiber delay, tap DEMUX, and close the ring.


7. Scale to multi-λ by adding sources, then the DWDM MUX/DEMUX, then additional PD channels.

Short version: Ising models give you a physics-native way to cast hard ML/optimization subproblems into a spin system your optics can relax on; shadow tomography warns you there’s an information bottleneck when you try to measure lots of things from few states/exposures. Both touch your hardware in deep ways—and both can become rabbit holes if you don’t respect their limits.

How they touch your hardware

1) Ising models (QUBO / spin-glass framing).

Many useful subproblems in your loop—ternary quantization (−1/0/+1), sparse mask selection, routing, clustering, even certain training steps—can be written as minimizing an Ising energy

∈{−1,+1} (or a ternary extension).

Your optics already looks like an analog relaxer: linear couplings via free-space kernels / MDM lanterns / fiber meshes (≈ the 
𝐽
J matrix), saturating SOAs or modulators for the nonlinearity (spin squashing), and a feedback loop for annealing. So for some tasks, you can let the physics find low-energy configurations fast.

Caveat (rabbit hole #1): general Ising is NP-hard; embeddings, precision limits, and control overhead balloon quickly. It’s powerful as a module (e.g., for ternary weight selection, routing, or combinatorial side-tasks), not a silver bullet for whole-model training.

2) Shadow tomography (information limits on readout).

Informally: given a state 
𝜌
ρ and a huge family of measurements 
{
𝐸
𝑖
}
{E

	​

}, shadow tomography tells you how many copies/exposures you need to estimate all

1711.01053v2

 

1711.01053v2

Why it matters to you: if you treat a single camera exposure as “all M layer dot-products at once,” shadow-style reasoning says accuracy per output will be bounded by photon/SNR budgets and grows with 
𝑀
M. You’ll often need multiple exposures/integration windows or adaptive measurement sequences to keep errors in line—exactly the kind of “gentle” multi-measurement scheduling shadow tomography formalizes (gentle measurement, gentle search, postselected learning). 

1711.01053v2

 

1711.01053v2

Why it’s a “dark rabbit hole”

Illusion of free parallelism. Cameras give you D pixels “for free,” but to report M precise functionals (e.g., many masks/weights) you hit 
log
⁡
𝑀
logM and 
𝜀
ε costs in copies/integration time—even classically. Pushing M high without budgeting photons/time forces down per-output accuracy or forces longer runs. 

1711.01053v2

Destructive / state-damaging measurements (classical analogue). Shadow tomography’s “gentle measurement” story comes from quantum, but the moral holds in noisy analog optics: aggressive readouts (bright probes, nonlinear elements) change the medium (heating, carrier depletion, gain saturation). You need sequencing that’s “gentle” enough not to ruin later measurements. 

1711.01053v2

Embedding overhead in Ising. Mapping rich ML objectives into spins can explode variable count/precision and demand control loops whose digital overhead erodes your physics win. Great local tool; dangerous as a universal hammer.

Practical restrictions you’ll feel (even though you’re classical)

Sample/Exposure complexity: Expect total exposure budget to scale at least like

 per output; multiplexing more outputs in one exposure splits photons/SNR across them.

Detector limits: Full-well capacity, read noise, PRNU; these set hard ceilings on simultaneous accurate M.

Coupler precision: Implementing dense 
𝐽
J (Ising) or many masks needs stable phase/amplitude control; errors push you into spin-glass landscapes (local minima).

I/O bottlenecks: Reading all outputs digitally can dominate wall-clock; prefer on-optic accumulation, compressive readouts, or staged/gated measurements (shadow-style adaptivity).

Worst-case hardness: Ising/QUBO remains NP-hard; the optics gives heuristic speed/parallelism, not guaranteed global optima.

How to use this constructively

Map shadow-style quantities onto your loop.

Let 
𝐷
D = number of resolvable optical modes / camera pixels used; 
𝑀
M = number of distinct linear readouts (masks/weights) you want per state; 
𝜀
ε = targeted per-readout accuracy.

1711.01053v2

Prefer adaptive measurement schedules (choose the next mask based on where your current hypothesis is wrong) to conserve exposure budget—the “postselected learning” + “gentle search” moral. 

1711.01053v2

 

1711.01053v2

Use Ising where it shines, not everywhere.

Good fits: ternary mask selection, structured pruning, routing/assignment, small combinatorial bottlenecks inside each iteration.

Keep embeddings small, use coarse/ternary spins (fits your “ternary trick”), and gate annealing schedules with your existing feedback loop.

Measure few energy terms per cycle (don’t try to read every coupling); use local observables and a small set of global monitors.

Adaptive measurement loop (“gentle” scheduling).

Maintain a hypothesis of the current mask responses; select the next mask to probe where error is largest; throttle probe intensity to limit state perturbation; update via online convex methods (matrix MWU). (This is the classical analogue of the postselected learning + gentle search combo.)

State-damage model.

Include saturation, heating, carrier lifetime; make measurement SNR vs. subsequent SNR a function of probe energy (“gentleness” control).

Ising submodule.

Provide an optional Ising/QUBO solver block with realistic analog constraints: limited precision 
𝐽

, noisy couplings, bounded anneal rate; report embedding overhead and success probability (local minima rate).

Output throttling strategies.

Offer three readout modes: (a) Compressive: project to K≪M random/features then reconstruct; (b) Batched masks: M split across B batches to keep SNR per mask high; (c) On-optic accumulation: accumulate weighted sums optically and digitize only a few scalars.

Ternary-aware accuracy.

Track decision error rates for {-1,0,+1} classification under finite SNR; show how fewer levels relax ε and reduce required exposure count (but watch bias thresholds).

Bottom line:

Ising models are a good tool in the toolbox for specific combinatorial substeps; use them surgically.

Shadow-tomography-style limits are the discipline your simulator needs: they keep your expectations honest about how many accurate readouts you can squeeze from a small number of exposures. Your optics gives you massive constant-factor wins (parallel pixels, low energy per MAC), but the
